* Team Communication

 Team communication is an essential part of any project. And wasting time looking for technical
 project information can be costly and frustrating. Clearly, any IT project will benefit from

 * Online javadoc
 
 * Quality assurance
 
   * Static code audits with Checkstyle or PMD
   
   * Unit test reports
